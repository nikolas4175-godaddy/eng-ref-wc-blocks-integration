# Context

WooCommerceâ€™s Cart and Checkout blocks bring the WP Block Editor (aka Gutenberg) interface to WooCommerce, allowing merchants to preview the look and feel of their checkout experience in the site admin while providing a more streamlined, React-driven checkout experience for customers on the frontend. 

Previously, the Cart and Checkout pages in WooCommerce could be output only via [WordPress shortcodes](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-shortcodes/), which would print the necessary HTML and supporting assets like JS code and CSS styles when viewed in the front-end. The blocks take a rather different approach as, while they can still be inserted in a standard WordPress page in the form of a block component, they are entirely React-driven, utilizing a different templating model (JSX) and set of JS events compared to the previous shortcode implementation.

While Woo plans to retain the existing shortcode system for backwards compatibility, block-based checkout will be the default experience for new installs starting in v8.4 (scheduled early Nov).

As such, many of our WooCommerce extensions need updating to integrate our existing backends with the new block-based frontend that Woo has constructed. 

# General Architecture

ðŸ”—Â WC Developer Blog (~2 min): [Understanding the Architecture of Cart and Checkout Blocks](https://developer.woocommerce.com/2023/09/18/architecture-of-cart-and-checkout-blocks/)

Hereâ€™s a rough outline of the contextual layers that our plugin integrations will be operating within:

```json
WP Page {
	WP Blocks {
		(...any other blocks on the page)
		WC Cart Block {
			Inner Blocks [
				Cart Items {...},
				Cart Summary {...},
				(...),
				Proceed to Checkout Button,
			]
		}
		WC Checkout Block {
			Inner Blocks [
				Billing Fields {...},
				Shipping Fields {...},
				Payment Fields {...},
				Order Summary {...},
				(...),
				Place Order Button,
			]
		}
	}
}
```

And here are some examples of what the default Cart and Checkout blocks look like on the site

## Payment Method Integration

Woo has implemented their own abstract class and several registration/integration methods specifically to help streamline payment method integration with their blocks.  

### Declaring plugin block compat

Gateway plugins still need to declare block compatibility at the plugin level (same as other block integrations). We can use the same FW methods for this in `Blocks_Handler.php` [code](https://github.com/godaddy-wordpress/wc-plugin-framework/blob/release/cart-checkout-blocks-support/woocommerce/Blocks/Blocks_Handler.php).

[ Code example of declaration (I think this is just the new plugin constructor args?) ]

### BE PaymentMethodRegistry

Next youâ€™ll need to add your payment method to Wooâ€™s `PaymentMethodRegistry` to [â€¦what does this do specifically?]. We have FW methods for this level of integration in `Gateway_Blocks_Handler.php` [code](https://github.com/godaddy-wordpress/wc-plugin-framework/blob/release/cart-checkout-blocks-support/woocommerce/payment-gateway/Blocks/Gateway_Blocks_Handler.php). This registration method calls `get_checkout_block_integration_instance()` on the integrating gateway class, which should return your `Gateway_Checkout_Block_Integration` instance (described in the next step).

`add_action( â€˜woocodmmerce_blocks_payment_method_type_registrationâ€™ [â€¦])`

[ Code example of `get_checkout_block_integration_instance()`implementation ]

### Gateway Integration Class

Each integrating gateway should extend the `Gateway_Checkout_Block_Integration` class to provide Woo with the integration details for rendering your FE. This includes the base gateway block checkout scripts and styles to load in an `initialize()`method, as well as the data that should be exposed to those scripts via `get_script_data()`. 

### FE Block Payment Method Script

The base JS module for your gateway block integration. The core of this module is a JS object that defines a set of options specific to your payment method which is passed to Wooâ€™s FE Block Registry via their `registerPaymentMethod()` function.

```js
import { registerPaymentMethod } from '@woocommerce/blocks-registry';

const AuthorizeNetCIMCreditCardGateway = {
	name: 'my_payment_method',
	content: <Content />,
	edit: <Description />,
	canMakePayment: () => true,
	label: settings.title,
	ariaLabel: settings.title,
	placeOrderButtonLabel: __( 'Continue', 'woocommerce-gateway-authorize-net-cim' ),
	supports: {
		features: settings.supports,
	},
};

registerPaymentMethod(AuthorizeNetCIMCreditCardGateway);
```

### Payment Method Components

In the Block Registry options, Woo allows us to define two base nodes, `content` and `edit` , that will be cloned and rendered in the frontend and admin editor respectively. Those nodes will contain all of the UI and logic needed for customers to enter and submit payment details (in `content`) and for merchants to preview the checkout experience in the admin editor (in `edit`).
